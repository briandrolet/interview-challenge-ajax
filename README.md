## The challenge
This is a coding challenge that will involve handling AJAX requests, parsing data, filtering results, and manipulating the DOM.

The page is a simple list of user profiles. Your objective is to write the `index.js` and `profiles.php` code to get the list
of profiles and show them in the DOM.

Inside `index.js` you'll find two existing GET ajax requests to `profiles.php`.

Make sure the data sent back matches the parameters in the ajax requests.

Read the comments in `index.js` for how the elements should be rendered.

Inside are a few files:
* App.php - helper class
* index.js - all javascript for the app
* index.php - the app entry point
* profiles.json - serialized data for user profiles
* profiles.php - a controller for getting profiles

## Instructions
* Fork the repository
* Start a local PHP server by running `php -S localhost:3000`. Then go to the URL at http://localhost:3000
* Do your work - try to make commits as you would in production
* Create a pull request
